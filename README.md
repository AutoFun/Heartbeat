# An IoT-based Smart Heartbeat Monitoring System
---
This thesis project proposed a wireless heartbeat monitoring system based on the modern IoT
techniques. The system hardware consists of Arduino and its Wi-Fi shield which collect
heartbeat measurements from the heartbeat sensor to the web application via selected
Wi-Fi network. A cloud database was designed and developed to store the incoming
data for data processing. The system is equipped with a mobile application with a
friendly design which allows the user to interact with the system in a smart way.
