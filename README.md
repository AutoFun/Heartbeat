# An IoT-based Smart Heartbeat Monitoring System
---
This thesis project proposed a wireless heartbeat monitoring system based on the modern IoT
techniques. The system hardware consists of Arduino and its Wi-Fi shield which collect
heartbeat measurements from the heartbeat sensor to the web application via selected
Wi-Fi network. A cloud database was designed and developed to store the incoming
data for data processing. The system is equipped with a mobile application with a
friendly design which allows the user to interact with the system in a smart way.

## Proposed system achievements

The proposed system takes advantage of the Arduino Wi-Fi shield which make the
hardware act as a single web server. And the source codes of the web application are
uploaded to an independent folder of Arduino board. The system web application can be
queried wirelessly by a specific URL with a Wi-Fi connection.

This system take advantage of the cloud database developed and maintained by Mongo
Cloud. Compared with the projects which store the data locally or using traditional
database, this system has a high expectancy. Cloud database is suitable for various IoT
frameworks and AI tools. In the future, it can also update with AIoT frameworks.

Similar to many IoT healthcare system projects, the proposed system also has
application to support the services and provide functions. This proposed system has the
web server embedded on the hardware and the function are smarter than a lot of
traditional projects. One feature on the data presentation is the echart was used to add
data visualization features for this project. The data was output as different charts or
diagram to help user to analyse the heartbeat results.
